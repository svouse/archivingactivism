    <h1>The Archiving Activism Project</h1>
    <p>
        Although minority activism shaped the racial geography of Austin and its educational institutions, there is no central and accessible space on or offline where students, community members, or researchers can access this information. Archiving Activism is a digital humanities project stewarded by Dr. Ashant√© Reese and Dr. Ashley Farmer that seeks to make this information publicly accessible and usable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project consists of three components: (1) documenting and digitizing historical documents related to minority student activism for an interactive website, for which we are seeking planning support; (2) integrating this information into student service learning; and (3) developing Freedom Schools to disseminate this information to the wider Austin community. The ultimate goal of this project is to create an accessible, open-access digital archive of student activism in Austin and to use this archive as the basis for research symposia, publications, curriculum, course development, and student service learning.
