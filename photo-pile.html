            <h1>Freedom Schools</h1>
            <p class="description">Iterations of freedom schooling—makeshift, free, and temporary schools—created for and by the Black
                                   community have existed since enslavement. However, Freedom Schools took on new forms and life in
                                   the during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, when groups like the Student Non-Violent
                                   Coordinating Committee developed Freedom Schools across the South aimed at fostering social change
                                   and voter registration. Since then, Freedom Schools have been a vital part of the Black intellectual and
                                   activist tradition, helping community members share resources, exchange information, and engage in
                                   popular education.
                                   The Archiving Activism team holds Freedom Schools aimed at helping students, organizers, and
                                   community members in Austin and beyond learn how to preserve and collect their archives and provide
                                   the tools needed to begin creating their own digital archives. Participants share and learn about the
                                   history of their community and their causes, critically examine their current circumstances, and imagine
                                   new futures as they archive.</p>
